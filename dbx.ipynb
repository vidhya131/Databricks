    "* ✅ **3 physically separate datacenter locations**\n",
    "* ✅ Independent power, cooling, and networking\n",
    "* ✅ Low-latency connection between zones (typically < 2 ms)\n",
    "* ✅ Designed for high availability and zone-redundant deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "You can deploy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Zone-redundant services (like ZRS storage)\n",
    "* Zone-pinned VMs\n",
    "* Multi-AZ architectures for 99.99%+ uptime designs\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, tell me what service you're planning (VM, AKS, SQL, etc.) and I’ll explain how AZ works for that specifically.\n"
